# Odoo 17 Docker Setup with Single Volume

This guide will help you set up Odoo 17 in a Docker container with a single volume for persistent data storage. You can use this guide to run the setup on both **Docker Desktop (Windows)** and **Ubuntu Server VPS**.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** installed on **Windows** or **Docker** installed on **Ubuntu Server VPS**.
- An Odoo 17 Docker image (`iifast2/odoo17-img:1.0`) with PostgreSQL and Supervisor installed.

## Dockerfile Overview

Here is the Dockerfile used to set up Odoo with a single volume that stores all necessary files (PostgreSQL data, Odoo logs, and configuration):

```dockerfile
# Use your pulled Docker image as the base image
FROM iifast2/odoo17-img:1.0

# Update and install necessary packages if missing
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    postgresql \
    supervisor \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Expose the necessary port for Odoo
EXPOSE 8069

# Define a single Docker volume for all necessary files
VOLUME ["/data"]

# Command to start all necessary services when the container is run
CMD service postgresql start && \
    service supervisor start && \
    supervisorctl start odoo17 && \
    tail -f /data/odoo17/odoo17.log
```

This Dockerfile does the following:

* Installs PostgreSQL and Supervisor (if needed).
* Exposes port 8069 for Odooâ€™s web interface.
* Defines a single volume (/data) where PostgreSQL data, Odoo logs, and configuration files will be stored.
* Starts PostgreSQL, Supervisor, and Odoo when the container is run.


## Running the Container on Docker Desktop (Windows)

### Step 1: Prepare the Host Directory
Create a directory on your Windows machine that will serve as the persistent volume for the container. For example:

```
C:/Users/yourusername/Desktop/odoo-data
```

### Step 2: Run the Container
Use the following command to run the container with the volume mapped to your host directory:

```
docker run -d -p 8069:8069 --name odoo17-container \
  -v C:/Users/yourusername/Desktop/odoo-data:/data \
  odoo17-img-with-services
```

Explanation:
-p 8069:8069: Maps port 8069 on the container to port 8069 on your Windows machine. You will access Odoo at http://localhost:8069.
-v C:/Users/yourusername/Desktop/odoo-data:/data: Maps your host directory (C:/Users/yourusername/Desktop/odoo-data) to the container's /data directory. This will store PostgreSQL data, Odoo logs, and configuration files in a single location on your Windows machine.
odoo17-img-with-services: The Docker image that runs Odoo, PostgreSQL, and Supervisor.

### Step 3: Access Odoo
After the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

``` 
http://localhost:8069
```

You should see the Odoo web interface.

## Running the Container on Ubuntu Server VPS

### Step 1: Prepare the Host Directory

Create a directory on your Ubuntu VPS that will serve as the persistent volume for the container. For example:

```
mkdir -p /path/on/host/data
```

### Step 2: Run the Container

Use the following command to run the container on your Ubuntu VPS:

```
docker run -d -p 8069:8069 --name odoo17-container \
  -v /path/on/host/data:/data \
  odoo17-img-with-services
```

Explanation:
-p 8069:8069: Maps port 8069 on the container to port 8069 on your VPS. You will access Odoo at http://<your-vps-ip>:8069.
-v /path/on/host/data:/data: Maps your host directory on the VPS (/path/on/host/data) to the container's /data directory. This will store PostgreSQL data, Odoo logs, and configuration files in a single location on your VPS.
Step 3: Access Odoo
Once the container is running, access Odoo by opening your browser and navigating to:

```
http://<your-vps-ip>:8069
```

You should see the Odoo web interface.

## Understanding the Volume Mapping
The `-v` flag maps a directory on your host machine to a directory inside the **Docker container**. This allows you to persist files across container restarts, and makes it easier to access or manage these files.

* **On Windows:** The host directory might look like `C:/Users/yourusername/Desktop/odoo-data`.
* **On Ubuntu VPS:** The host directory might look like `/path/on/host/data`.
Inside the container, the mapped directory is `/data`, and it contains:

* `/data/postgresql`: PostgreSQL data for your Odoo database.
* `/data/odoo17`: Odoo log files.
* `/data/config`: Configuration files for Odoo.
This setup consolidates everything into a single volume, making backups and management much simpler.

## Troubleshooting
Container Exits Immediately After Starting
If the container exits immediately, check the logs using:

```
docker logs odoo17-container
```

This will provide details about what might have gone wrong during startup.

# Run instructions & Dockerfile : 

```
# Use your pulled Docker image as the base image
FROM iifast2/odoo17-img:1.0

# Update and install necessary packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    postgresql \
    supervisor \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy your custom supervisor configuration file if you have one
# COPY odoo17.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/odoo17.conf

# Expose the necessary port
EXPOSE 8069

# Command to start all necessary services when the container is run
CMD service postgresql start && \
    service supervisor start && \
    supervisorctl start odoo17 && \
    tail -f /var/log/odoo17/odoo17.log

```

```
docker build -t odoo17-img-with-services .
```

```
docker run -d -p 8069:8069 --name odoo17-container odoo17-img-with-services
```

Files inside container and thier paths :

```
/opt/odoo17
/usr/bin/python3.10
/etc/odoo17.conf
/etc/supervisor/conf.d/odoo17.conf
/var/log/odoo17
```

### odoo 17 config file :

```
admin_password = admin
db_user = odoo17
addons_path = /opt/odoo17/addons
logfile = /var/log/odoo17/odoo17.log

```

<br/>


```
sudo su - postgres
```

```
sudo supervisorctl start odoo17
sudo supervisorctl status
```

<br/> 


### Enable Supervisor to Start at Boot

To make sure Supervisor starts automatically when the container starts, you should add the following to your Dockerfile or entrypoint script:
```
CMD ["supervisord", "-n"]
```
